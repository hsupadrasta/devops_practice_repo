For End-to-End (E2E) testing, the goal is to simulate user behavior and data flow through the entire application stack, which often includes multiple interconnected APIs. Here's a detailed goal with specific objectives:

### Goal: Ensure Full Application Workflow Integrity Through E2E Testing

**Objective 1:** Design and implement a comprehensive E2E testing framework that covers all user journeys by Q3 2024, ensuring that each workflow functions correctly from the user interface down to the data layer.

**Objective 2:** Automate E2E test cases to be executed as part of the nightly build process, aiming for daily validation of the application's workflow integrity.

**Objective 3:** Integrate E2E tests into the CI/CD pipeline to enable automatic triggering of tests upon code commits, ensuring immediate feedback on the impact of changes.

**Objective 4:** Develop a set of performance benchmarks for E2E tests to ensure that user workflows not only complete successfully but also perform within acceptable time frames.

**Objective 5:** Create a monitoring and alerting system for E2E tests to quickly identify, report, and respond to any failures or performance degradations in the application workflows.

By achieving these objectives, E2E testing can help assure stakeholders that the application, as a whole, not only meets functional requirements but also delivers a consistent and reliable user experience.
