Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today, I'm excited to present a transformative solution that my team, GBS_GCOR QA3, has been working on.

In our current workflow, regression test cases are selected and prioritized largely by human judgment. This method, while valuable, has its drawbacks. It's time-consuming and doesn't guarantee that the most impactful areas of our application are being tested first. 

We've proposed a game-changing solution: an ML-based Regression Test Prioritizer. This tool will revolutionize our approach by automating the selection process. Rather than testing everything for every release, we can now pinpoint the areas of code most affected by recent changes and prioritize those for testing. 

The way it works is quite simple yet powerful. By leveraging machine learning, our tool assesses the impact of code changes and suggests a tailored set of regression tests. This is not only efficient but ensures high-risk areas are not overlooked.

The benefits are substantial. We're talking about a significant improvement in regression testing performance, a robust aid in calculated risk assessment, and a marked reduction in costs. Furthermore, we position ourselves to be more responsive to market changes, and we enhance our team's productivity.

As we look to the future, the vision is clear: moving from a broad, one-size-fits-all testing strategy to a focused, intelligent, and prioritized approach. Our tool is the bridge from 'testing everything' to 'testing smart.'

I'm proud of the progress we've made and I'm confident that with this Regression Test Prioritizer, our development, QA, and BA teams will be more equipped to deliver high-quality software in a more efficient and effective manner.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to any questions you might have.

...By automating the selection process, our ML-based tool not only optimizes test coverage but also ensures we're efficiently utilizing our resources. 

Let me walk you through the benefits we'll reap with this innovation. First and foremost, it promises improved regression testing performance. That means we can rapidly identify the most crucial areas for testing, ensuring no critical issue slips through the net.

Moreover, our tool will help us calculate risks more accurately. Instead of relying on intuition, we'll have data-driven insights to guide our decisions, reducing the likelihood of unexpected issues during production.

Costs will see a downturn as well. By prioritizing our test cases, we minimize unnecessary tests and focus our efforts where they matter most, significantly reducing the hours spent on redundant testing.

We'll also be able to respond to market changes with agility. This tool empowers us to adapt our testing process quickly as our application evolves, keeping us competitive and responsive.

Lastly, the productivity of our teams will see a new high. With clear guidance on where to focus, our development, QA, and BA teams can work smarter, not harder, ensuring high-quality deliverables in a fraction of the time.

In summary, our Regression Test Prioritizer isn't just a new tool; it's a pivotal step towards a more intelligent, impactful, and efficient testing process.
