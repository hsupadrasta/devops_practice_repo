Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today, I'm excited to present a transformative solution that my team, GBS_GCOR QA3, has been working on.

In our current workflow, regression test cases are selected and prioritized largely by human judgment. This method, while valuable, has its drawbacks. It's time-consuming and doesn't guarantee that the most impactful areas of our application are being tested first. 

We've proposed a game-changing solution: an ML-based Regression Test Prioritizer. This tool will revolutionize our approach by automating the selection process. Rather than testing everything for every release, we can now pinpoint the areas of code most affected by recent changes and prioritize those for testing. 

The way it works is quite simple yet powerful. By leveraging machine learning, our tool assesses the impact of code changes and suggests a tailored set of regression tests. This is not only efficient but ensures high-risk areas are not overlooked.

The benefits are substantial. We're talking about a significant improvement in regression testing performance, a robust aid in calculated risk assessment, and a marked reduction in costs. Furthermore, we position ourselves to be more responsive to market changes, and we enhance our team's productivity.

As we look to the future, the vision is clear: moving from a broad, one-size-fits-all testing strategy to a focused, intelligent, and prioritized approach. Our tool is the bridge from 'testing everything' to 'testing smart.'

I'm proud of the progress we've made and I'm confident that with this Regression Test Prioritizer, our development, QA, and BA teams will be more equipped to deliver high-quality software in a more efficient and effective manner.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to any questions you might have.
