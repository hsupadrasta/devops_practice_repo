Hashing for image similarity involves generating a fixed-length hash code or signature that represents the content of an image in a way that similar images produce similar hashes. Here's a simplified implementation using a perceptual hashing method called dHash (difference hash):

1. **Resize the Image:** Start by resizing the input image to a fixed size. For simplicity, you can choose a small size like 8x8 pixels.

2. **Convert to Grayscale:** Convert the resized image to grayscale if it's not already in grayscale. This simplifies the process.

3. **Calculate Pixel Differences:** Calculate the difference between adjacent pixels in the image. You can do this row-wise or column-wise, depending on your preference. For each pair of adjacent pixels, if the left pixel is brighter than the right pixel, assign it a value of 1; otherwise, assign 0.

4. **Generate the Hash:** Combine the binary values obtained from step 3 to create a hash. This can be done by treating the binary values as bits of an integer and converting it to a hexadecimal or binary string.

Here's a Python example using the popular Pillow library for image processing:

```python
from PIL import Image

def dhash(image_path, hash_size=8):
    # Open and resize the image
    image = Image.open(image_path).convert('L')
    image = image.resize((hash_size + 1, hash_size), Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Calculate differences and generate hash
    diff_values = []
    pixels = list(image.getdata())
    for row in range(hash_size):
        for col in range(hash_size):
            left_pixel = pixels[row * (hash_size + 1) + col]
            right_pixel = pixels[row * (hash_size + 1) + col + 1]
            diff_values.append(int(left_pixel > right_pixel))
    
    # Convert binary list to a hexadecimal hash
    hash_hex = ''.join([str(val) for val in diff_values])
    return hash_hex

# Usage
image_path = 'your_image.jpg'
hash_code = dhash(image_path)
print(f'dHash: {hash_code}')
```

This code will give you a dHash for the input image. Similar images should have similar dHashes, making it a straightforward way to measure image similarity. Remember to adjust the `hash_size` parameter to suit your needs, as a larger hash size might capture more details but be less robust to minor changes.
