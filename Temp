For a comprehensive E2E testing strategy focused on API interactions, here are the detailed objectives:

### Goal: Ensure Comprehensive Validation of Application Workflows via API-Driven E2E Testing

**Objective 1:** Create a suite of E2E automated test cases that leverage API calls to validate complete application workflows, ensuring that every function performs as expected from start to finish. Plan to complete this suite by Q3 2024.

**Objective 2:** Implement E2E tests that cover all critical business transactions, including alternative and exception paths, to guarantee the API behaves correctly under various scenarios by the end of Q4 2024.

**Objective 3:** Integrate the automated E2E API tests into the nightly build process to provide regular, consistent validation and early detection of integration issues, targeted for Q1 2025.

**Objective 4:** Develop performance benchmarks specifically for API-driven E2E workflows to ensure they meet response time criteria under typical and peak load conditions, with benchmarks established by Q2 2025.

**Objective 5:** Establish a monitoring system for E2E API tests that provides real-time alerts and detailed reports on test outcomes to facilitate rapid response to any issues, to be operational by Q3 2025.

These objectives are designed to ensure that your E2E testing not only verifies the individual API endpoints but also assures that the entire chain of operations, as triggered and carried through by API interactions, meets the functional and performance requirements.
