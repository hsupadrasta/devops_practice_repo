# Performance Testing Tool - User Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the Performance Testing Tool user guide. This tool allows you to perform performance tests on API endpoints using pre-recorded request headers. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- The Performance Testing Tool executable (`.exe`) file.
- The `test_template.csv` file containing test parameters.

## Installation
1. Download the Performance Testing Tool executable from [link].
2. Download the `test_template.csv` file.

## Setting Up Test Parameters
1. Place the `test_template.csv` file in the `C:\Users\userid\` directory.
2. Open the `test_template.csv` file and provide the following details for each test case:
   - `endpoint`: API endpoint to test.
   - `method`: HTTP request method (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE).
   - `body`: Request body for POST/PUT requests (leave empty for GET/DELETE).
   - `threads`: Number of concurrent requests to execute.
   - `run`: Set to `1` to run the test case, or `0` to skip it.

## Running the Performance Test
1. Double-click the `PerformanceTestingTool.exe` file.
2. The tool will prompt you to copy request headers from your browser's network tab. To do this:
   a. Open your web application and navigate to the API page.
   b. Open the browser's developer tools and go to the Network tab.
   c. Run the application to capture network requests.
   d. Right-click on the network event corresponding to the API request and copy the request headers.
3. Return to the command prompt and paste the copied headers, then press Enter.

## Viewing Results
- Once the tool completes the tests, the results will be stored in the same location as the executable with the name `test_results.csv`.

## Conclusion
You've successfully used the Performance Testing Tool to perform performance tests on API endpoints. Customize the `test_template.csv` file and follow the steps provided to analyze the results.
