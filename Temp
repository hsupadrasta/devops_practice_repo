To forward an email with high importance and then delete it using VBScript, you can modify the script as follows:

```vbscript
Set Outlook = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
Set Namespace = Outlook.GetNamespace("MAPI")

' Access the Inbox folder
Set Inbox = Namespace.GetDefaultFolder(6).Items

' Find the email to forward
For Each Mail In Inbox
    If Mail.Subject = "Email Subject to Forward" Then
        ' Forward the email
        Set ForwardMail = Mail.Forward
        ForwardMail.Subject = "Fwd: " & Mail.Subject
        ForwardMail.Importance = 2 ' High importance
        ForwardMail.Recipients.Add "recipient@example.com"
        ForwardMail.Send
        
        ' Delete the original email
        Mail.Delete
        Exit For
    End If
Next

Set Inbox = Nothing
Set Namespace = Nothing
Set Outlook = Nothing
```

In this script:

- Replace `"Email Subject to Forward"` with the subject of the email you want to forward.
- Replace `"recipient@example.com"` with the email address of the recipient to whom you want to forward the email.
- The `Importance` property is set to `2` to indicate high importance. The values for the `Importance` property are: `0` (Low), `1` (Normal), and `2` (High).

This script will search for an email with the specified subject in the Inbox, forward it with high importance to the specified recipient, and then delete the original email from the Inbox.
